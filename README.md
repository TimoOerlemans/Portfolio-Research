## Reading guide

This is my reading guide about my IP and GP project.

## Individual project

For my individual project I want to make a sort like domino's application. 

### 1. What did I use for my individual project?
For my individual project I used a Java based framework for the back-end and a Javascript based framework for the front-end. The main reason for my decision is because I want to learn how to work with Java and Javascript, so that later I can work with other frameworks and not just one. 
After I have chosen which framework I am going to use. I am going to look up some tutorials to learn how it works.

### C4 Model
The four C's stand for: context, containers, components and code. These models are describes architecture at different levels. The higher you go in the C4 model the more detail you can see. 

#### C1
In the image below you can see the first level of the C4 model. This is my context model. In this model there are no details just general things about my application. You can see who the user is and directly connected systems.

#### C2
The second model is the container diagram. This one describes the software system and shows all the API's, databases, applications and microservices that the system uses. It also shows how my containers communicate with eachother.

#### C3
The third model is the component diagram. This diagram shows code from one single container.

#### C4
The final model is the code with class diagram. This shows the code of how one single component works. You can make a classdiagram or an EER.

## Activity diagram
After the C4 model I made an activity diagram.

## Wireframes

I made some UI-designs so that I know where to place the components
