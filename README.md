## Reading guide

This is my reading guide about my IP and GP project.

## Individual project

### 1. What did I use for my individual project?
For my individual project I used a Java based framework for the back-end and a Javascript based framework for the front-end. The main reason for my decision is because I want to learn how to work with Java and Javascript, so that later I can work with other frameworks and not just one.
