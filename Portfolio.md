## Portfolio

Here I go through all the learning outcomes that I need to prove so I go to the next semester.

## Learning outcomes



## Outcome 1. You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications. (IP & GP)

I think I am standing for this LO on oriÃ«nting because in my readme file you can see my research on frameworks. After these descicions I want to learn how to work with these frameworks so I have found a few tutorials that I am going to follow. 

#### design

For my individual project I made a few Wireframes so I have an idea of how my app looks.

For this lo I think I have to make some design for my application, do research for what kind of framework to use, make a final product and then test it on people who have not seen the product.

## Outcome 2. You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development. (IP)

For this lo I think I have to choose which type of testing I need for my project and I need to do the DOT research for this lo.
I didn't do anything for this lo yet. that is why I am on undefined


## Outcome 3. You can implement the software process for your project according to a given agile software development method. (GP)

In the groupsproject we use an agile way of working based on SCRUM. We do daily stand-ups, stand-downs and Peer review so everbody can say something about everyone. We also work in sprints of three weeks were we devide tasks to everyone in each sprint. 

This lo is about agile working. I need to understand what agile working is and implement it into my groupproject.

I think I am on orienting because I know what agile working is and we are using it in our groupproject. We are working in sprints of 3 weeks where we all have our own tasks. If a task is done you can pick up an other task and work on that. Also are we holding a standup and standdown every day for the groupproject days.

## Outcome 4. You implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context. (IP)

This lo is about automated software. An example is that my application runs every test when you push. 
undefined because I haven't looked good enough to this.


## Outcome 5. You recognize and take into account cultural differences when working with multi-site teams and are aware of ethical aspects in software development. (GP)

Here I have to know how different type of culturals work(some culturals work different than other culturals).

I have worked a little bit on this because when I was making user stories you need to look at what every culture wants.
undefined

## Outcome 6. You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using multiple types of test techniques. (GP)

In my group project I participated in making user stories but we all did just one or two. In my individual project I have made multiple user stories. From those user stories I made the C4 model that you can find in the readme file.

For this Lo I need to make architectural designs, make requirements and test with different techniques. I think I am standing here on orienting bacause in my own project I have made some of the architectural designs and understand what they mean.

[C4 model](https://github.com/TimoOerlemans/Portfolio-Research/blob/main/README.md#c4-model)

## Outcome 7. You can explain simple business processes and relate them to the development of your software project. (GP)

For this LO I did some research about what a business process is. I answered some questions about this topic and for the visuals I made two activity diagrams(first one before the software applied and the second with) with draw io.

## Outcome 8. You act in a professional manner during software development and learning. (IP & GP)

For individual I am going try to use pomodoro and also I am going to make a projectboard where all my features stand that I need to make.
