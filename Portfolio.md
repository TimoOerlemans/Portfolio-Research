## Portfolio

Here I go through all the learning outcomes that I need to prove so I go to the next semester.

## Learning outcomes



## Outcome 1. You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications. (IP & GP)

I think I am standing for this LO on oriÃ«nting because in my readme file you can see my research on frameworks. After these descicions I want to learn how to work with these frameworks so I have found a few tutorials that I am going to follow. 

For my individual project I made a few Wireframes so I have an idea of how my app looks.

## Outcome 2. You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development. (IP)

undefined



## Outcome 3. You can implement the software process for your project according to a given agile software development method. (GP)
undefined

In the groupsproject we use an agile way of working based on SCRUM. We do daily stand-ups, stand-downs and Peer review so everbody can say something about everyone. We also work in sprints of three weeks were we devide tasks to everyone in each sprint. 


## Outcome 4. You implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context. (IP)

undefined


## Outcome 5. You recognize and take into account cultural differences when working with multi-site teams and are aware of ethical aspects in software development. (GP)

undefined



## Outcome 6. You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using multiple types of test techniques. (GP)

In my group project I participated in making user stories but we all did just one or two. In my individual project I have made multiple user stories. From those user stories I made the C4 model that you can find in the readme file.

## Outcome 7. You can explain simple business processes and relate them to the development of your software project. (GP)

undefined



## Outcome 8. You act in a professional manner during software development and learning. (IP & GP)
