## 1. Java framework 
 
#### 1.1 What is Java and Java framework?
Java is an OO based language just like .NET. 
Java frameworks are bodies of prewritten code used by developers to create apps using the Java programming language. Java frameworks are only for the Java programming language.

#### 1.2 Which Java frameworks are there?
There are many Java frameworks but I am only going to compare a few: Spring, Payara and Jetty.

In the image above you can see I have compared these frameworks. All of them have there own pros and cons. That is why I choose Spring for my back-end framework.

## 2. Javascript frameworks

#### 2.1 What is Javascript?
Javascript is a programming language to make front-end. So what the user sees on his screen. 

#### 2.2 Which Java frameworks are there?
I also have to choose in what type of framework I am going to work for the front-end. 
<img width="512" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99472273/157016579-d72df7be-de27-4197-a316-99646c9794f4.png">

In the image above you see three frameworks that I have compared in the image of Java frameworks you can see Spring works good with React. Some sites said it is a personal choice. That is why I choose react as my front-end framework.

## 3. Business processes
Here I am going to describe LO7:You can explain simple business processes and relate them to the development of your software project. To show it completely I am going to answer a few questions.

#### 3.1 What is a business process?
According to my source: "A business process is an activity or set of activities that can accomplish a specific organizational goal." There are groups of people and each group have there own speciality. And we start with one group who are going to do there thing but when they are done the goal is not yet been achieved. So to achieve the goal the first group gives there end product to the next ect. until the last group has done there job. 

#### 3.2 How a business process relates to software applications? 
The business process is the process(steps) made to achieve the goal for the user. The relation between the two is that software should make sure that less steps have to be made to achieve that goal. For example: in a restaurant in there are robots who pick up dirty dishes from the tables and brings plates to the tables. This replaces the work from a waiter. There are many other examples where software ensures that the business process gets achieved faster.

#### 3.3 Process related to my project

For my own project I am going to make a website for a pizza restuarant. This sofware allows the customer to order product before he gets there and so he doesn't have to wait or he doesn't even have to pick his own order. Because of my software the costumer doesn't have to wait long for his food or has to leave his own house. 

In the image below you can see the flow of how the process was before my software:

<img width="299" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99472273/158561676-59bf2bd8-cf22-49a2-9d7a-f68a6e6fab56.png">

Underneath this you can see the image of when my software is used:

<img width="299" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99472273/158566548-3f2df730-33fe-44c9-bbec-023c717cd98d.png">

As you can see the cashier is not longer necessary in the second flow. The costumer can have the same amount of steps if he choses to pick up his own order. The delivery can be a new roll if the costuner choses that he wants his order deliverd.

## 4. CI/CD

#### 4.1 What is CI/CD
CI stands for Continuous Integration and CD for Continuous Delivery. It is a way of working in a software team where certain steps are done automatically. 

CI is about an automatic way of developing code. For example when i have changed a few things or implemented something new then it will automaticly run all the test. If the test are all passed then he will push the code otherwise it will reject the new commits. CD is about simplify making code changes and get it on different environment.

## 5. Cultural differences and ethics

Can I work with people who are different from me?

### 5.1 What is culture?

I have found this source (Wikipedia)

>"Culture is a word for the 'way of life' of groups of people, meaning the way they do things. Different groups may have different cultures. A culture is passed on to the next generation by learning, whereas genetics are passed on by heredity. Culture is seen in people's writing, religion, music, clothes, cooking and in what they do."

In my own words: Culture is a way how a curtain group does things like writing, be with family and music. I have been in contact with many different cultures so I know that every group has his own way of communicating. Therefore I can be different with different type of cultures.

### 5.2 Can you give examples for cultural differences that you have experienced in your study or life? How do you explain these differences?

I work in a sushi restaurant where almost only Chinese people work in the kitchen. They make all these dishes that I would never eat if I didn't have worked there. One day they made fish head soup I didn't try that one because the smell made me a little bit ill. Another day they made chicken legs and not chickenwings but the real legs from the chicken. I tried one of them and didn't like them. When I am home we just eat like patatoes or a fake Chinese recipe.

### 5.3 What is your culture?

I am Dutch, so mostly we eat dutch food at home and on occasion we eat something else. We have some typical dutch food like syrup waffles, Poffertjes and a lot of cheese. <br>
In the Netherlands we celebrate a few holidays like sinterklaas, carnaval(only the south of the netherlands) and halloween. <br>
In our culture is sport a really big thing in my eyes. Everyone I know plays minimun of 1 sport mostly soccer or hockey. But cycling is the one thing we as dutch people do the most accourding to [this](https://discerningcyclist.com/which-city-has-the-most-cyclists-statistics/).<br>
But most importantly dutch people are very direct, opinionated, greedy and realistic. Most dutch people just say everything they think.

### 5.4 What did you do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences? 

In my second semester we had someone who came out Syria. He could not speak dutch that well and was very different in the way he talked and the topics. So as group we helped in when he couldn't follow everything what we said. Also when we had to presentate something to the class or stakeholders we helped him what he could say. 

In the semester therefor I had someone who was religious so she went to the church and believed in jesus. Some of our group then used to curse a lot with goddammit. She told us that she didn't like that so we took that into account.  

### 5.5 What is ethics in software engineering?

According to [this](https://ethics.org.au/about/what-is-ethics/) site.

>"Ethics is the process of questioning, discovering and defending our values, principles and purpose. It’s about finding out who we are and staying true to that in the face of temptations, challenges and uncertainty. It’s not always fun and it’s hardly ever easy, but if we commit to it, we set ourselves up to make decisions we can stand by, building a life that’s truly our own and a future we want to be a part of."

### 5.6 Why is ethics important in software engineering? 

Ethics are important for software engineering because people don't need to be affected in a bad way. As example if a boss asks software engineers to make something that gets all there data even thought he doesn't need it would you still do it.

### 5.7 What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? 

According to Daniel Alcanja.

>"There is a really useful set of rules called the Software Engineering Code of Ethics that indicates the moral and professional commitments of software engineers. This code was created by a global team made up of mechanical, government, military, and instructive experts. 

These are the eight principles created by the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics:

1. Public: Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

2. Client and employer: Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

3. Product: Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

4. Judgment: Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

5. Management: Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

6. Profession: Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

7. Colleagues: Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

8. Self: Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession."

By the 7th principle they say something about fair and supportive to other colleagues. In my own words that means that everyone should respect every colleague. The fair part is that you tell to another colleague if something is wrong and not just say that everything is good. The second part says that you should be supportive and in our group we already do that by helping each other if something doesn't work with someone.
We do that by say something where they can find what they are looking for or sit next to them and help them by explaining. 



### 5.8 How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 

If you talk to anohter software engineer and you don't have the same opinion about a topic you have to share your view with the other and find a middle. You have to look at eachother work and be really critical and say what is in your mind.

### 5.9 Which ethical aspects play a role in your project? 

In my groupsproject we have to be professional to each other but also to our teachers and stakeholders. This is even a whole learning outcome in the group- and individualproject. I do this by asking the teachers for feedback every two weeks or so. We speak the stakeholders every sprint which last 3 weeks. Further we do a feedback moment where we talk about the group almost every sprint.

### 5.10 Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?

I found a [tool](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/12096/files/1577291/download?wrap=1) in the canvas course.

We make a traval dashboard that let you see your booked trips and offers for next trips.

**Possible stakeholders**:
Everyone that books a trip on this site.

**Privacy**:
We make sure that not everybody can see everyones booked trips so we made an inlog system that checks if the person is the person who says he is. 

**Bad Actors**:
Some people can see personal data and use this against them. Also they can take there tickets and update them so they can use the tickets.

**Human Values**:
Users can check there information without calling someone from the companie so an ethic conflict is that a few people could lose there job because of this.

**Future Impact**:
This is just the first step in the walk towards the future. In an Utopian version is that everyone still have there job and they can work calmer. In a dystopian situation eveyone can lose there job and everything get automated.
