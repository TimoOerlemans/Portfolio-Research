## 1. Java framework 
 
#### 1.1 What is Java and Java framework?
Java is an OO based language just like .NET. 
Java frameworks are bodies of prewritten code used by developers to create apps using the Java programming language. Java frameworks are only for the Java programming language.

#### 1.2 Which Java frameworks are there?
There are many Java frameworks but I am only going to compare a few: Spring, Payara and Jetty.

In the image above you can see I have compared these frameworks. All of them have there own pros and cons. That is why I choose Spring for my back-end framework.

#### 1.3 Sources

[Spring](https://spring.io/)

[Payara](https://www.payara.fish/)

[eclipse-Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/)

## 2. Javascript frameworks

#### 2.1 What is Javascript?
Javascript is a programming language to make front-end. So what the user sees on his screen. 

#### 2.2 Which Java frameworks are there?
I also have to choose in what type of framework I am going to work for the front-end.

In the image above you see three frameworks that I have compared in the image of Java frameworks you can see Spring works good with React. Some sites said it is a personal choice. That is why I choose react as my front-end framework.

## 3. Business processes
Here I am going to describe LO7:You can explain simple business processes and relate them to the development of your software project. To show it completely I am going to answer a few questions.

#### 3.1 What is a business process?
According to my source: "A business process is an activity or set of activities that can accomplish a specific organizational goal." There are groups of people and each group have there own speciality. And we start with one group who are going to do there thing but when they are done the goal is not yet been achieved. So to achieve the goal the first group gives there end product to the next ect. until the last group has done there job. 

#### 3.2 How a business process relates to software applications? 
The business process is the process(steps) made to achieve the goal for the user. The relation between the two is that software should make sure that less steps have to be made to achieve that goal. For example: in a restaurant in there are robots who pick up dirty dishes from the tables and brings plates to the tables. This replaces the work from a waiter. There are many other examples where software ensures that the business process gets achieved faster.

#### 3.3 Process related to my project

For my own project I am going to make a website for a pizza restuarant. This sofware allows the customer to order product before he gets there and so he doesn't have to wait or he doesn't even have to pick his own order. Because of my software the costumer doesn't have to wait long for his food or has to leave his own house. 

In the image below you can see the flow of how the process was before my software:

Underneath this you can see the image of when my software is used:

As you can see the cashier is not longer necessary in the second flow. The costumer can have the same amount of steps if he choses to pick up his own order. The delivery can be a new roll if the costuner choses that he wants his order deliverd.
