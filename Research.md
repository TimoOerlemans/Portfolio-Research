## Individual project

### 1. Java framework 
 
#### 1.1 What is Java and Java framework?
Java is an OO based language just like .NET. 
Java frameworks are bodies of prewritten code used by developers to create apps using the Java programming language. Java frameworks are only for the Java programming language.

#### 1.2 Which Java frameworks are there?
There are many Java frameworks but I am only going to compare a few: Spring, Payara and Jetty.

In the image above you can see I have compared these frameworks. All of them have there own pros and cons. That is why I choose Spring for my back-end framework.

### 2. Javascript frameworks

#### 2.1 What is Javascript?
Javascript is a programming language to make front-end. So what the user sees on his screen. 

#### 2.2 Which Java frameworks are there?
I also have to choose in what type of framework I am going to work for the front-end.

In the image above you see three framework that I have compared. Some sites said it is a personal choice. That is why I choose react as my front-end framework.
